# Scheme or Common Lisp

Scheme has been described as clean and simple. Common List powerful but ugly.

Scheme tends to be used more as a teaching language while Common Lisp tends
to be more used in commercial applications.

## Major features of Common Lisp

1. Powerful macro support (when and unless)

2. Variety of looping constructs (the language tends to encourace looping over recursion)

3. Format (similar power to C printf)

4. Exception handling

5. Collections

## Differences in syntax between Common Lisp and Scheme
* defun / define
* function definition (defun square (x) (* x x)) (define (square x) (* x x))
* let / define to define local vaiables
* Built-in object system (CLOS)
